# FlagSwitch React

FlagSwitch React is a feature flagging utility for React apps, engineered to dynamically load and manage feature components based on versioning and traffic splits. Itâ€™s built to help you roll out features progressively and perform A/B tests with minimal friction.

---

## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install flagswitch-react
```

---

## Getting Started

### Basic Setup

Import and initialize the feature loader with global settings (if needed), then define your feature flags with a traffic split.

```tsx
// index.ts
import { flagSwitch } from "flagswitch-react";

// Initialize the feature loader with optional global settings.
const loadFeatures = flagSwitch({
  // global options can be set here
});

// Define feature flag configurations with traffic splits.
const CheckoutFlow = loadFeatures({
  split: {
    "single-step-checkout": 30,  // 30% of users
    "multi-step-checkout": 70,   // 70% of users
  },
});
```

> **Important:** Ensure that feature components exist in the `/src` directory next to your `flagSwitch` call and are exported as the default export.

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Global Options

Customize how FlagSwitch React resolves and loads your feature components by passing global options to the `flagSwitch` function.

```tsx
import { flagSwitch } from "flagswitch-react";

const loadFeatures = flagSwitch({
  path: {
    postfix: "feature", // Appends 'feature' to the module path.
    delimiter: ".",     // Uses '.' as the separator.
  },
  namePattern: /(?<name>[^\/]+)$/, // Regex to extract the feature name from a file path.
  flags: {
    // Define any global flags that apply across multiple features.
    [featureName]: {
      // feature-specific global configuration
    },
  },
});
```

### Feature-Level Definitions

When you load features, you can specify how each feature should behave:

#### Traffic Splitting (`split`)

Distribute user traffic between different versions of a feature. If omitted, an even split is assumed.

```tsx
loadFeatures({
  split: {
    "single-step-checkout": 30,
    "multi-step-checkout": 70,
  },
});
```

#### Forcing a Specific Version (`version`)

Explicitly choose a feature version to load. If not set, the version is selected based on the `split` configuration.

```tsx
loadFeatures({
  version: "single-step-checkout", // Force the single-step version.
});
```

## Roadmap

- **Webpack Support:** Integration for seamless bundling.
- **Dynamic Feature Flag Fetching:** Load flags dynamically from external sources.
- **Multi-Organization & Environment Support:** Configure flags across different environments.
- **Enhanced Versioning:** Support for multiple feature versions with metadata using the `name_version_metadata` pattern.
